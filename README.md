# T3Wallet
During my internship at SovereignT Labs, I developed a unique Android application designed to serve as a bridge between Web2 and Web3 by facilitating the creation and management of decentralized digital identities. This innovative app incorporates several key features, including:

1. Seamless Signup Process: When users sign up, a POST API call is made, and the received data is securely stored in a Room database.
2. SOV ID Integration: A unique decentralized identifier, SOV ID, is fetched dynamically through an API response, ensuring secure identity      management.
3. Live Blockchain Price Updates: The app provides real-time updates on the prices of major blockchains, including Ethereum and Bitcoin,        offering users valuable insights.
4. Account Management for Transactions: Users can add and manage accounts, enabling seamless and secure transaction processing.
5. User Authentication: The app supports both login and signup functionalities to ensure a smooth user experience.
